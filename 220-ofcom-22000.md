  ### Case 1: dsmigin failure
  
  * Problem 
    * dsmigin fails with below message
    ```
    ofcom_odbc: SQLConnect failed
    - State: ERRCL
    - Native Error: -2131
    - Error Message: [unixODBC] Generic I/O error.
    012504 E MIG0201E ams_initialize() failed. - rc = -22110
    ```
  * Solution
    1. Check if tibero is running, by using command ps -eLf | grep tbsvr 
    ```bash
    jh_lee@jh_lee:~$ ps -eLf | grep tbsvr
    jh_lee    2637  2334  2637  0    1 02:56 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto tbsvr
    ```
    2. If you see no tbsvr process running, it means the tibero has not been booted up. So you have to make it down and then boot it by using:
    ```
    jh_lee@jh_lee:~$ tbdown clean
    jh_lee@jh_lee:~$ tbboot
    ```
    3. Now, if you try to use migrate the dataset, it will give the below message:
    ```
    (E) CLI3003 unable to connect to main server : 127.0.0.1 [CLI0106] [Connection refused]
    (E) CLI0100 getenv error : TMAX_BACKUP_ADDR [CLI0102]
    013528 E MIG0222E lockm_lock_all() failed. - rc = -1
    013528 E MIG0603E Failed to import - rc = -1
    ```
    So in this case, you type:
    ```
    jh_lee@jh_lee:~$ tmboot
    jh_lee@jh_lee:~$ tjesmgr boot
    
    ```
    After that, you should be able to migrate without any issues
